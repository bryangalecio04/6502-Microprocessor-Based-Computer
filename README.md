# 6502-Microprocessor-Based-Computer
The 6502 Microprocessor is an old but revolutionary hardware component that served as the heart of many groundbreaking computer systems like the Apple II, Atari 800, and the Nintendo Entertainment System, to name a few. As a Computer Engineering student passionate about computers, I discovered the 6502 microprocessor while researching CPUs and immediately became eager to get my hands on one to test and expand my knowledge of computer architecture and development by building a fully functional computer with it. The aim of this project was to assemble the hardware and write a program in Assembly to output the phrase 'Hello, World!' on an LCD display. The beauty of computers, especially one powered by the 6502, lies in the endless possibilities of things you can make them do by expanding on its software or hardware, and this is something I plan to explore further as I continue my journey as a Computer Engineering student.
